        	<h2>Overview</h1>
					<p>The goal of this site is to provide a competitive way to interact with other MLS fans. At the start, this will purely be a way to make predictions about upcoming MLS games and try to prove your knowledge about the MLS compared to other fans. Hopefully we will add additional leagues and tournaments to the site soon!<p>
					<br>
					<h2>Schedule</h2>
					<p>The ScoreMaster league is split into two different "seasons" when compared to the MLS regular season. Season 1 will occur from the start of the MLS season and run until the All Star break. Season 2 will begin after the all star break and end before the playoffs begin.</p>
					<h2>How to Win</h2>
					<p>The player with the most correct predictions at the end of each season will be awared <b>$100 dollars!</b> This player will be contacted using the email address associated with their account. If they do not respond <b>within 7 days</b>, the player with the next largest number of correct predictions will be awarded the money. In the event of a tie, the money will be split between all players tied at first. If one or more players does not respond to the email for their prize money, then this money will simply go towards the next remaining winning <p>
